## AI-Assistance Disclosure

This project contains work created or refined with the assistance of AI-based tools.  
As a neurodiverse developer with reading and writing difficulties, I use AI to support written
communication, improve documentation, and assist with translations into languages I do not speak.
AI is also used for code completion in repetitive or boilerplate scenarios and for generating early
drafts that I then refine manually.

Using these tools helps me spend significantly more time on feature development, maintenance,
and long-term project support.

### Scope of AI Usage

AI tools are used primarily for:

- Rewriting or improving documentation and comments
- Creating translation drafts
- Assisting with repetitive or boilerplate code patterns
- Generating early concept sketches or placeholder ideas for artwork

These AI-generated concepts are used only as references and are not included as final assets.

### Manual Work and Creative Control

All technical concepts, architectural decisions, algorithms, gameplay logic, and final
implementations are created manually.  
AI is not used to define system behavior or make engineering decisions, but rather to support
productivity and clarity where appropriate.

The same applies to artistic work:  
Final pixel art, 3D models, textures, icons, and other creative assets are hand-crafted.  
AI may be used to explore ideas at a conceptual level, but final assets are created manually.

Some artwork may be created by commissioned artists. These assets follow their own copyright terms
and are normally not AI-generated.

### Licensing

The project’s code is provided under its open-source license.  
Artistic assets, textures, models, icons, logos, and other visual materials are excluded from the
open-source license and may not be reused without permission.  
The use of AI assistance does not change or extend any licensing terms of this project.
